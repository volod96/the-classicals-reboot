## the-classicals-reboot
A brand new try on the old project [The Classicals](https://github.com/volod96/the-classicals).

### What is this?
Using `Spring Boot` for backend, `MySql` from Amazon and `Angular 6`, this project is a *Single Page Application* development prototype intended for learning the aforementioned platforms.

### Can you get more technical?
Of course. The database structure can be viewed [here](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/34614c78-4dea-4eb4-b097-a1c076c32d13). 
Currently I am working on a RESTful service on the backend side. In order to focus on implementing business logic features, the server will be running from a C9 workspace or even localhost.
No structure has been set regarding frontend yet.
